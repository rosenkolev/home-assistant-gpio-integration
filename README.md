## Installation

### HACS

The recommend way to install `gpio_integration` is through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **pigpiod** is required.

### Manual installation

Copy the `gpio_integration` folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's
`custom_components` folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config`
folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. You
may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the `gpio_integration`
folder and all of its contents into it.

## Interface

The integration uses `pigpio` as default interface to access the GPIO board and fallback to other options when `pigpio` is not found.

The [gpiozero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/) library is used and the integration supports all interfaces `gpiozero` supports.

* pigpio
* lgpio (fallback)
* rpigpio (fallback)
* native (fallback)

> [!NOTE]
> The integration is created in a way that can be extended for other hardware like 'Asus Tinker Board' or 'ODroid' but I don't have the hardware to implement it and anyone is welcome to do so (see [Contributing section](#contributing))

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `pigpio` interface requires `pigpiod`. See the [Interface Advanced Configuration section](#interface-advanced-configuration) for details.

## Usage

### Configuration

To configure the integration use the UI

![Configuration variation!](/docs/step_variation.png)

![Configuration flow first step!](/docs/step_setup.png)

> [!CAUTION]
>
> * `unique_id` is not required and will be created automatically based on `Name`.
> * **Pin numbers are GPIO pin numbers and not the actual pin order of the board**. See the [Wikipedia article about the Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#General_purpose_input-output_(GPIO)_connector) for more details.

### Binary Sensor

* [Binary Sensor](./docs/BINARY_SENSOR.md) - A generic binary sensor set as on/off based on GPIO input.

### Cover

Entities for controlling `cover`, `shade`, `roller` or `awning`.

* [Cover with up/down switch](./docs/COVER.md#cover-with-updown-switch) - A cover with `up/down` buttons and an optional `closed` state sensor. \
  Supports `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `STOP` and `SET POSITION` features.
* [Cover with toggle switch](./docs/COVER.md#cover-with-toggle-switch) - A cover with single `toggle` button and an optional `closed` state sensor. \
  Supports `OPEN` and `CLOSE` features.

### Switch

* [Switch](./docs/SWITCH.md) - A generic switch output.

### Light

* [Light](./docs/LIGHT.md#light-pwm-or-bulb) - Can be used for LED dimmable (PWM) light and a bulb. \
  Supports `FLASH` and `EFFECT`.
* [Light (RGB)](./docs/LIGHT.md#light-rgb) - An RGB colored LED light \
  Supports `FLASH` and `EFFECT`.

### Fan / Motor

* [Fan / Motor](./docs/FAN.md) - A fen or motor entity controlled from 0-100% power. \
  Supports `SET_SPEED`, `TURN_ON` and `TURN_OFF`.

### Sensors

* [Analog step sensor](./docs/SENSORS.md#analog-step-sensor) - Analog sensor based on the **MCP** chip that calculate value based on a min/max/step inputs.
* [Distance sensor](./docs/SENSORS.md#distance) - An ultrasonic distance sensor.
* [DHT22/DHT11 sensor](./docs/SENSORS.md#dht22-humidity-and-temperature) - And DHT humidity and temperature sensors.

### Servo

* [Servo](./docs/SERVO.md) - A Servo motor output. \
  Uses degrees (e.g. 180Â°)

## Contributing

For details refer to [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Interface Advanced Configuration

* pigpio - supports all features (require `pigpiod` running)
* rpigpio - `Home Assistant` OS uses [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/) python package that have [issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6037) preventing EDGE detection. When not using HA OS You must install alternative like [rpi-lgpio](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-lgpio/).

### pigpiod

`pigpio` connects to [`pigpio-daemon`](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html), which **must be running**.

* On `Home Assistant` this daemon can be installed as an add-on [Poeschl/Hassio-Addons](https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons/tree/master/pigpio).
* On `Raspbian` 2016-05-10 or newer the pigpio library is already included.
* On other operating systems it needs to be installed first ([see installation instructions](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html)).

### Configure

You can force to use a specific underlying library by modifying the `configuration.yaml`.
By default `pigpio` will be use with `localhost` as host (`gpio = pigpio.pi()`).

```yaml
gpio_integration:
  interface: pigpio
  host: remote.pc
```

| | |
| - | - |
| interface | `pigpio`, `lgpio`, `rpigpio`, `native` |
| host | Host (only for pigpio) |
